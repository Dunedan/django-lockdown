CHANGES
=======

3.0.0. (2020-01-01)
-------------------

- Added support for Python 3.8.

- Added support for Django 3.0.

- Removed support for Python 2.7 and 3.4.

2.0.0 (2019-05-26)
------------------

- Added support for proxies when using IP-address based lockdown exceptions.

- This introduces a breaking change: Installations running behind a proxy will
  need to set the newly introduced ``LOCKDOWN_TRUSTED_PROXIES``, otherwise
  access won't be granted anymore, when accessing the site through a proxy.

- Added the ability to whitelist views when locking down a whole site using
  the middleware.

- Added support for Django 2.2.

- Only require ``mock`` as separate third-party test dependency for
  Python <3.3.

- Fix detection of compacted IP-addresses.

- This introduces a breaking change for users which make use of the
  ``REMOTE_ADDR_EXCEPTIONS`` feature and passed the IP-addresses to except as
  byte strings in the configuration. While it's unlikely somebody did that
  with Python 3, it's the default for Python 2. With this version, byte
  strings don't work anymore, but using unicode strings is required.

- Add the ability to specify IP-subnets for remote addresses exception.
